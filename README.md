# NEDAS Master II Material (Università degli Studi dell'Aquila)

Welcome to my repository for the 1st year of the NEDAS (Networks and Data Science) Master's program at the University of L'Aquila. This repository serves as a collection of materials, notes, and projects related to my coursework and research during the first year of the program.

## What's NEDAS? 
The NEDAS program focuses on the foundational elements of modern computing applications: complex networks and big data. With the internet embodying this combination—a decentralized network with billions of nodes and a massive amount of data—it's crucial to understand the critical activity of transforming data into information.

Students in the NEDAS program delve into advanced concepts and methodologies applied to graphs and web algorithms, computational intelligence, databases, data analytics, game theory, and beyond. This curriculum is designed to equip students with the skills to manage the complex relationship between networks and big data, while also maintaining a concrete connection with the ever-evolving world of ICT applications across various domains.

## How to Use This Repository
Students and enthusiasts can use this repository as a reference for the NEDAS program's first-year curriculum. Whether you're looking for insights into a particular course, examples of applied projects, or study materials, you'll find a wealth (or better: a mess) of information categorized by subject.
